We're going to get started.
Handouts are the by the door if anybody iddn't pick one up. 如果谁还没有拿到讲义请在门口领取。
My name is Charles Leiserson.
I will be lecturing this course this term,Introduction to Algorithms. 这学期将由我来指教这门课，算法导论。
with Erik Demaine.   和我一起执教的是Erick Demaine.
In addition, this is an SMA course, a Singapore MIT Alliance course .这是一门SMA课程，即新加坡-MIT 联盟课程。
Which will be run in Singapore by David Hsu. 将由David Hsu 提供给新加坡。
And so all the lectures will be videotaped.   所有课程将被录像。
and made an available on the web for the Singapore students ,并通过网络提供给新加坡的学生。
as well as for MIT students who choose to  watch them on the web. MIT 的学生也可以在网上选择观看。
If you have an issue of not wanting to be one the videotape, 如果你不想上镜头，
you should sit in the back now.                              你就坐到后排去。
OK ?  Otherwise ,you will be on it                            好吗？ 否则，你就会出现在镜头里。
There is a video recording policy,but it seems like they ran out.  有个关于录像的条款，但是貌似已经发完了。
If anybody wants to see it,                                        如果谁想看下这个条款
people,if they could just sort of pass them around maybe a little bit,  同学们，你们可以相互借阅下，
once you're done reading it ,or you can come up.              还没看到的可以来我这里。
I did secure one copy.                                         我这里还留有一份。
let's before we get into the content of the course,            在我们开始这门课之前
let's briefly go over the course information .                 先概括下这门课的全貌。
because there are some administrative things that we sort of have to do.  因为这门课有一些规定，我们得简单说下。
As you can see, this term we have a big staff.                           如你所见，这学期我们有很多助教。
So, Take a look at the handout here .                                   看看这里的讲义。
Including the term six TAs,                                               共有6个助教。
which is two more TAs than we normally get for this course .                这比我们之前在这门课中的助教多了2名。
That means recitations will pe particularly small.                          这就是说复习课能够做到十分小班化
There is a world wide web page.                                           我们做了一个网站
and you should bookmark that and go there regularly                          你应该把它加入收藏并且经常访问它。
because that is where everything will be distributed                              因为这门课的所有相关信息都是在那里发布

even though we give you our email address                                        即便我们给了你们邮箱地址。
to the individual members of the staff.                                          也不要直接发给某一名教职人员。
