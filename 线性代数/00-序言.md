Now,if you learn linear algebra without getting a solid foundation in that geometric understanding. 假如你在学习线性代数时，并没有几何上的直观理解作为坚实的基础。
the problems can go unnoticed for a while. 问题可能暂时不会浮出水面。
until you've gone deeper into whatever field you happen to pursue. 但是当你在你的研究领域中继续钻研的时候，他就会显露出来。
whether that's computer science,engineering, statistics,economics,or even math itself. 不管事计算机科学，工程学 ，统计学 经济学还是数学本身，这个道理都是一样的。
Once you're in a class,or a job for that matter, that assumes fluency with linear algebra. 当你坐在教室 或者开始从事一项工作，都需要你通晓线性代数知识.
the  way that your professors or your co-workers apply that field could seem like utter magic. 你的教授或者同事所做的就如同魔法一般
They'll very quickly know what the right tool to use is , and what the answer roughly looks like. 他们很快就知道应该使用什么方法，以及答案的大致样子。
in a way that would seem like computational wizardry if you assumed that. 如果你猜测他们处理的是繁杂无章的数据,你可能还会以为他们有什么奇特的计算方法。
they're actually crunching all the numbers in their head.
Here,as an analogy, imagine that when you first learned about the sine function in trigonometry. 打个比方，假如你首次学习正弦函数 学到的是这样一个无穷次多项式。
you were shown this infinite polynomial.
This,by the way,is how your calculator evaluates the sine function.
For homework, you might be asked to practice computing approximations of the sine function, 你的作业则是通过代入不通的数字，并做合理的截断，来练习计算正弦函数的近似值。
And, in fairness, let's say you had a vague idea that this was supposed to be related to triangles, 再假设你对三角函数和正弦函数的关系有一点模糊的认识
but exactly how had never really been clear, and was just not the focus of the course.  但是确切是什么关系，你并不清楚 这也不是课程的重点
later on ,if you took a physics course , where sines and cosines are thrown around left and right. 后来，你去参加了一门物理课，正弦和余弦函数到处可见。
and people are able to tell pretty immediately how to apply them  其他人很快就知道如何使用这些函数
and roughly what the sine of a certain value will be  并且大致知道他的值是多少
